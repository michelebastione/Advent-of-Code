# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an annual recreational programming competition, in which thousands of people participate, consisting of 25 challenging problems, one for every day of December before Christmas. This repository contains my solutions to mostof those problems. Some solutions may require external libraries to run, especially numpy.
